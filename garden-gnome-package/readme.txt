Display panoramas, virtual tours or object movies created with Pano2VR and Object2VR.

## Description

This plugin provides an easy way to publish panoramas and object movies created with Garden Gnome Software's Pano2VR and Object2VR.

You can embed a package via a shortcode like `[ggpkg id=12]` or a block in the Gutenberg editor.

Sample packages can be downloaded from our [forum](https://forum.ggnome.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=9025).

### Shortcode

When you are using a shortcode to embed a package, you can provide additional parameters in the shortcode:

- width: the width of the player in the page

- height: the height of the player in the page

- start_preview: when set to 'true', the player will initially show as a preview image with a play button.

- start_node: if the package is a virtual tour, you can specify the start node. You can find the node ID of each node in the tooltip in the tour browser.

- start_view: for panoramas and virtual tours, sets the initial view of the first node. The format is 'pan/tilt/fov/projection'. The projection parameter is optional.

- url: can be used instead of ID, to embed a package from a specific URL. Like `[ggpkg url='....']`. This field needs to be enabled in the settings.

Example: `[ggpkg id=12 width='100%' height='500px' start_preview='true']`

If you are using the Gutenberg Editor and want to embed a package via a shortcode, use a *Classic Block* from the 'Formatting' section, and use the *Add Media* button to add a package from the media library.

### Gutenberg Block

You can find the GGPKG Gutenberg Block in the Widgets section.

In the GGPKG Block, you can pick a package from the media library.

In the Inspector panel on the right, you can specify if the package should start with a preview image and a play button, and set the width and height of the player in the page.

### Elementor Widget

You can find the Garden Gnome Package Widget in the General section.

In the Widget settings, you can pick a package from the media library, define the height, and select if it should start with a preview image.

##  Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a Garden Gnome Package?

A Garden Gnome Package is a simple ZIP file that contains everything necessary to display a single panorama, virtual tour, or object movie. After uploading the package, the plugin extracts the archive.

### How can I create a package? 

Please see the [Pano2VR documentation](https://ggnome.com/doc/pano2vr/guide/export/output-web/ggpkg/) or [Object2VR documentation](https://ggnome.com/doc/object2vr/guide/export/output-web/ggpkg/).

### How can I upload a tour with a large file size? 

The easiest solution is to install the excellent [Big File Uploads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tuxedo-big-file-uploads/) plugin.

There are two strategies without an additional plugin:

- Upload the tour to a folder on a web server and use the shortcode `[ggpkg url="https://example.com/my_tour_folder/"]` to point to the tour.

- Upload a small version of the tour (i.e., just the start node) and then replace the files in the extracted folder in the upload directory.
